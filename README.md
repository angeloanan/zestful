# Zestful

A personal mood tracker

I have realized that at times, I do not truly understand on what I feel and have a hard time describing my mood.
This personal project of mine has an aim of developing my emotional intelligence by better understanding my emotions over time.

The project uses a simple, yet widely used Emotional Intelligence indicator: energy level vs. feeling (pleasantness).

Contributions are welcome, though not expected and not guaranteed to be merged; this is a personal project after all.

Feel free to fork and adapt this as your own mood tracker
